Cheese Pizza recipe:

-Ingredients
  -1/2 recipe homemade pizza crust
  -1/2–3/4 cup (127-190g) pizza sauce, depending how much you like (homemade or store-bought)
  -8 ounces sliced mozzarella cheese
  -1 and 1/2 cups (6oz or 168g) shredded mozzarella cheese
  -2–3 Tablespoons (10-15g) grated parmesan cheese
  -ground basil or Italian seasoning, to taste
  
  Instructions
1)    Prepare the pizza dough through step 6, including preheating the oven to 475°F (246°C) as described in step 4.
2)    Top the dough with the pizza sauce, then the sliced mozzarella, then the shredded mozzarella, grated Parmesan, then sprinkle with basil.
3)    Bake for 12-15 minutes. For the last minute, I move the oven rack to the top rack to really brown the edges. That’s optional.
4)    Slice hot pizza and serve immediately. Cover leftover pizza tightly and store in the refrigerator. Reheat as you prefer. Baked pizza slices can be frozen up to 3 months.
